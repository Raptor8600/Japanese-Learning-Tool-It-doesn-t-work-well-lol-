# Japanese Learning Tool (Experimental Web Port)

> [!WARNING]
> **This web version is currently BROKEN and barely works.** It is an experimental port of the original Python program. Use at your own risk.

## How to Play the Real Game (CLI Version)
If you want to play the actual working version of the tool (Command Line Interface):

1.  **Download** all the files in this repository (Code -> Download ZIP) and unzip them.
2.  Double-click `play_cli.bat`.
3.  This will launch the fully functional command-window version with:
    *   Flashcards
    *   Conversation Practice
    *   Vocabulary Browsing

## Web Version (Broken)
The files `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js` contain an attempt to port this to the web. It is not finished. To see the draft version of the web version, just open the `index.html` file.
